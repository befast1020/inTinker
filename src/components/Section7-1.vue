            “So glad I found InTinker. After a year of replacing parts, upgrading parts, constantly trying different brands
            of filament, and printing nothing but Calibration tests (unsuccessfully), including planes, cubes, boats etc. I
            finally googled 3D Printer calibration software and my 3D printing hobby was forever changed.<br /><br />

            Let's be honest, we own our printers to do cool things and I was not doing any of that until I found inTinker.
            Thank you for helping me get back on the road to printing amazing pieces no matter what filament I am using and
            always being there to answer any question I have along the way to keep me on the road printing away.<br /><br />

            If you are on the fence and thinking this is something you'll use once and it's not worth the sub, think again.
            I bought the year out of the gate and am glad I did. Even different color filaments in the same brand and PLA
            quality have needed their own printing profile to be perfect. You'll have this tab open 24/7 trust me. Thanks
            for making it so easy, Trevor!”
